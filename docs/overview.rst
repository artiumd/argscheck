Overview
========

The :mod:`argscheck` library provides means for simple but comprehensive argument checking for Python.

The main benefits are:

* Get rid of repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.
* Compose simple building blocks to perform complex checks.

    * Also enhances readability.
* Together with the informative error messages, allows you to quickly catch and fix bugs.
* :mod:`argscheck` closely follows the Python data model.

    * Checking is oriented towards behaviour rather than typing.
