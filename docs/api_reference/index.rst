API Reference
=============

This chapter lists all the classes and functions that can be imported from :mod:`argscheck`.

The following sections correspond to internal modules that group different types and behaviours.
Still, everything can be imported directly from :mod:`argscheck` without specifying sub-packages.

For the sake of brevity, throughout the API reference, the argument being checked is referred to as ``x``.
